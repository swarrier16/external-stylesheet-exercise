  <h1>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Theme Song</h1>
  <p>
    Now, this is a story all about how<br />
    My life got flipped-turned upside down<br />
    And I'd like to take a minute<br />
    Just sit right there<br />
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air<br />
<br />
    In west Philadelphia born and raised<br />
    On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br />
    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br />
    And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br />
    When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br />
    Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br />
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br />
    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air'<br />
<br />
    I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br />
    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br />
    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br />
    I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.<br />
<br />
    First class, yo this is bad<br />
    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br />
    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br />
    Hmm this might be alright.<br />
<br />
    But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that<br />
    Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?<br />
    I don't think so<br />
    I'll see when I get there<br />
    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air<br />
<br />
    Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br />
    There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out<br />
    I ain't trying to get arrested yet<br />
    I just got here<br />
    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br />
<br />
    I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br />
    The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br />
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br />
    But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel-Air'<br />
<br />
    I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br />
    And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later'<br />
    I looked at my kingdom<br />
    I was finally there<br />
    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air<br />
