  <h1>Friends Theme Song</h1>
  <p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br />
    Your jobs a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.<br />
    <br />
    It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br />
    And it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,<br />
    or even your year<br />
    but..<br />
    <br />
    I'll be there for you<br />
    When the rain starts to pour<br />
    I'll be there for you<br />
    Like I've been there before<br />
    I'll be there for you<br />
    ''cause you're there for me too...<br />
  </p>
